# names

  Generate random names. I could not find where I originally found these lists. But thanks, random internet contributor. 
  
  Feel free to add new names to the lists.
  
## Usage

    var names = require('names');
    
    // Returns a string with a random forename concatenated with a random surname, ex: 'Trevor Gerhardt'
    var randomName = names();
    
    var listOfForenames = names.fore;
    
    var listOfSurnames = names.sur;
    
    // That's it
